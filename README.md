## About

This is the source code for the personal site of me, Chris Gibbons, Principal UI/front end developer & UX technologist from just outside the seaside town of [Blackpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpool). Feel free to have a poke around, ask me questions, but don't steal it.

I've [re-built this site](https://gbbns.co) and it's now using [Astro](https://astro.build), it's open sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/gbbns/astro.gbbns.co) and proudly hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
