Welcome to the first, and hopefully not last, of my public weeknotes (likely to be sporadic, but we'll get there!)

The mighty, and extremely friendly, [Paul Smith](https://www.paulsmith.site), as well as my colleague [Toli](https://www.toli.io/), have provided me with the impetous to try and get "back" into weeknoting...

## Things I've done

- Relaunched this site! Kicked [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) to the gutter and in with the lovely [AstroJS](https://astro.build/) - hat tip to [Simon Scarfe](https://twitter.com/simonscarfe), his constant banging of the drum made me take a look.

## Things I've read

- [https://github.blog/2022-12-02-introducing-mona-sans-and-hubot-sans/](https://github.blog/2022-12-02-introducing-mona-sans-and-hubot-sans/) Lovely new variable font from GitHub, going to have a play with it and see if it's worth changing this site's font...
- [Paul's weeknotes](https://paulsmith.site/weeknotes/), unashamedly borrowed some of the language from his. Hoping that overtime, mine _might_ get somewhere near his level. Great work, mate.

## Things I've watched

- [Andor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andor_(TV_series)) - Finally finished it, and I bloody enjoyed it. Also enjoyed seeing my home town of [Cleveleys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thornton-Cleveleys) [feature in it too](https://www.lancs.live/whats-on/whats-on-news/star-wars-andor-shows-thornton-25303404)!
