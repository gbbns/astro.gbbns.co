      <h2>A potted history</h2>
      <p>
        {siteMetaData.author.name} is an experienced (15+ years) and passionate digital
        developer specialising in the &ldquo;lost art&rdquo; of traditional Front-End
        development practises, UI/UX and mobile, with a long time obsession for well
        written, semantic &amp; accessible code to help deliver cross-device, compliant,
        usable websites which are accessible &amp; inclusive.
      </p>
      <p>
        He sits somewhere in the murky waters between design, Front-End &amp;
        engineering. Strongly advocates for the use of design systems and spends
        large parts of his time rambling on about the use of &ldquo;proper
        semantics&rdquo; and{' '}

        , all to help make the web a far more accessible and inclusive place, for
        everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        He also hates speaking about himself in the third person, so lets stop.

        </a>{' '}
        for nearly 8 years, working my way up to Snr. Front End developer, I then
        spent the next 12 months working as UI engineer at{' '}
        <a href="https://www.zuto.com" rel="noopener"> Zuto</a>{' '}
        where I enjoyed the challenge of trying to build a bridge between Front-End
        and UX in the world of car finance.

      <p>
        Happily employed by the nice folk at{' '}

        }
        for 4 years as a Principal UX/UI developer and an advocate of accessibility
        &amp; inclusive design. Next up was a good stint as lead Front-End engineer
        with the lovely folks at{' '}
        <a href="https://www.coop.co.uk" rel="noopener"> Co-op</a>
        , where I helped to shape the future of the design system and other products
        for our colleages.

        Now building on my many years in Front-End, <strike
          >I&rsquo;m enjoying life</strike
        > I&rsquo;m coming to the end of my tenure at cinch as a Engineering Practice
        Lead, looking primarily at the Front-End practice. The role has helped me
        to grow and establish a much more comprehensive set of skills, rather than
        just engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my time here, Iâ€™ve helped and contributed towards initiatives that
        directly impact and improve teams and engineers, helping drive
        initiatives raised by the squads through discussions or working groups;
        A primary example is the direct contribution towards the Progression
        Framework for engineers, this helped to address exit interview comments
        around unclear progression within cinch.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also have a growing interest in DevOps (DORA/Space etc.), as well as
        the new serverless landscapes such as AWS.

      <h3>Design Engineer? UX Technologist? Design Technologist?</h3>
      <p>What, what, WHAT?!</p>
      <p>
        I&rsquo;ve been trying to find an accurate description for myself within
        the Front-End (FE) arena for a number years now, especially with the
        lines of what is expected of a FE-er becoming blurrier.
      </p>
      <p>
        It&rsquo;s no exaggeration to say that the FE landscape has changed
        dramatically in the 15 years I&rsquo;ve been in the industry. Task
        runners such as Grunt and Gulp weren&rsquo;t even twinkles in the eyes
        of the people who concieved the ideas. Object orientated approaches to
        frameworks such as Angular and React are commonplace and expected skills
        to have. Accessibility &amp; inclusive design is rightly gaining in
        prominence, but not enough for my liking!
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, the parts of FE I particularly enjoy is around the UI layer and the
        crafting of a great experience (think all good things like web
        standards, accessibility, web performance et al.), this along side
        prototyping &amp; discovery (mainly as I get to play).
      </p>
      <p>
        In my opinion&mdash;and after doing a few Google searches it seems there
        are many other people thinking the same&mdash;a UX/Design Technologist
        works to bridge the gap between design and engineering, this is exactly
        the area I love working in!
      </p>
      <p>
        <a
          href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924212518/http://adaptivepath.org/ideas/what-makes-a-design-technologist/"
          rel="noopener"
        >
          One of the best posts I read on this topic is from Dan Harrelson at
          Adaptive Path
        </a>
        .
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A comfort level with Front-End programming (web, desktop, mobile,
          device)
        </li>
        <li>
          A tool belt filled with techniques for creating interactive apps
        </li>
        <li>The ability to quickly pick up new tools</li>
        <li>A itch to dive into code and &ldquo;just build it&rdquo;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These all appear to reflect where I feel I add most value.</p>
      <p>But it was the following:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          You also need to find that special someone who appreciates design and
          wants to be a member of the UX team.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        That <em>really</em> sums up my current feelings, and also really reflects
        the "murky waters" where I see things differently to others.
      </p>
      <p>
        So there you have it, the title of a Design Engineer (or a Design
        Technologist) fits the bill nicely, and should give you better insights
        into the "what", of what I enjoy doing.
