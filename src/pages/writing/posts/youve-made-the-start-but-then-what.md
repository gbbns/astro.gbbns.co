Creating accessible experiences for our users is not something that is done once, you then put a tick in a box and it’s magically all completed, it’s so much more than that, it’s often a long and (sometimes very) frustrating process, moreover, it’s one that requires consistent attention, diligence, and collaboration across disciplines, inorder to mitigate these frustrations, and ultimately provide a better experience for all our users.

To ensure accessibility remains a priority it’s important to foster a culture that puts accessibility and inclusion first, as well as promoting the ongoing conversations around accessibility. Over the years, I found several successful ways to do this, including starting & cultivating communities of practice, running accessibility-related design critiques, and finally building design systems.

## Communities of Practice

Communities of Practice, also known as CoPs, are groups of people who share a common interest and come together to learn from one another and share best practices. In the context of accessibility, a community of practice can be a valuable resource for sharing knowledge and expertise on accessibility-related topics. This can help to ensure that your organization has a diverse range of perspectives on accessibility and can foster a culture of collaboration and continuous learning.

Communities of practice are groups of individuals who come together to share their knowledge, skills, and experiences in a specific field or area of interest. These communities can provide a valuable source of support and guidance for those looking to learn more about a particular subject, as well as a way for experts to stay up-to-date on the latest developments and best practices in their field.

One area where communities of practice can be especially beneficial is in promoting accessibility. Accessibility refers to the practice of designing products, services, and environments that are inclusive and usable by as many people as possible, including those with disabilities.

CoPs focused on accessibility can provide a space for individuals and organizations to discuss the latest accessibility standards and guidelines, as well as share strategies and solutions for making their products and services more accessible. Through regular meetings and discussions, members of these CoPs can learn from one another and gain new insights into how to improve accessibility in their work.

In addition to providing a forum for learning and sharing, CoPs can also help build momentum behind accessibility initiatives. By bringing together a diverse group of people with a shared interest in accessibility, CoPs can help raise awareness of the importance of accessibility and encourage others to get involved. Through collaboration and collective action, these communities can help drive change and push for greater accessibility in their organizations and beyond.

Furthermore, CoPs can help to foster a sense of community and belonging among those working on accessibility issues. By providing a supportive and inclusive environment, these communities can help individuals feel more connected to others who share their passion for accessibility and provide a sense of camaraderie and support.

## Design Critiques
Design critiques are another important tool for promoting accessibility. A design critique is a structured discussion where a group of people review and provide feedback on a design. This can be an effective way to identify potential accessibility issues and ensure that your design meets the needs of users with disabilities. By regularly conducting design critiques, you can ensure that accessibility remains a key consideration throughout the design process and can help to prevent potential accessibility issues from going unnoticed.

## Design Systems
Design systems are a set of standardized design principles, components, and guidelines that can help to ensure consistency and coherence in your organization’s designs. In the context of accessibility, a design system can provide a framework for creating accessible designs and can help to ensure that your organization’s designs are inclusive and user-friendly for people with disabilities. By implementing a design system, you can help to promote accessibility and ensure that it remains a key consideration in all of your organization’s designs.

Overall, communities of practice, design critiques, and design systems can be powerful tools for fostering a culture of accessibility and ensuring that accessibility remains a priority for your organization. By implementing these approaches, you can ensure that accessibility remains a key consideration in all aspects of your organization’s design process and can help to create user experiences that are inclusive and accessible for all.

Overall, communities of practice can play a valuable role in promoting accessibility and driving positive change. By providing a space for learning, sharing, and collaboration, these communities can help build momentum and support for accessibility initiatives, and foster a sense of community among those working to make the world more inclusive and accessible for all.
