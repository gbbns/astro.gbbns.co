Hello and welcome to episode 2 of this year&rsquo;s &ldquo;week notes&rdquo; series. I&rsquo;m going to try and get back into a more frequent cycle of writing these - probably every two weeks until I get a new job.

## Observations

üëª When did Ghosting become common practice? This really pisses me off, and recruiters (internal and external!) really should know better. I had one person hound me for a chat, we eventually managed to speak, then the fucker just ignores me, **repeatedly**. Bad form. ‚ùé

(Also, I&lsquo;m not saying I am without blame on this too, all I will say is that when you're set open to work it is very easy to be overwhelmed with messages, sometimes I miss messages from folks, and it can take me a while to reply. In this instance I'm classing ghosting as once you've already made contact with a company/recruiter, for it to then drop off)

üì£ Let&rsquo;s talk feedback. Give it. Don&rsquo;t fuck about giving the candidate something tangible that they can action for future opportunities.

üë®üèº‚Äçüéì I know that not every candidate is going to tick the right boxes, and through gritted teeth, I get it. I say gritted teeth as it feels at times that the criteria used to grade candidates is skewed, whereby someone who can score highly on values, apparently isn&rsquo;t the right fit as _they&rsquo;ve not coded for **8hrs a day**, for the **last 6 months**_, go figure ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Things I&rsquo;ve done

Applied for jobs, lots and lots of jobs. It&rsquo;s a tiring, thankless task, especially when dealing with a seemingly constant flow of boilerplate rejection letters.

It&rsquo;s not all doom and gloom, I&rsquo;ve had a few first-stage, exploratory-type calls, both fun and nerve-wracking. Speaking of nerve-wracking, let&rsquo;s have a chat about live coding sessions shall we. Bloody hell, I forgot just how anxiety-triggering these nasty little fuckers are. In the day(s) building up to the one I had on Wednesday my anxiety was through the roof.

It went well, or at least I thought it had, but I&rsquo;ve since had the dreaded _**we have decided not to move forward** with your application at this point in time_

Aside from the _relentless bullshit_ of the current job market, I&rsquo;ve been dabbling with [Spanish on Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/course/es/en/Learn-Spanish) - it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve been wanting to _try_ and learn for a while, slow and steady, and at least Duolingo is supportive and doesn&rsquo;t give degrading comments about my supposed lack of recent hands-on dev experience.

## Things I&rsquo;ve read

Lots of React-based stuff, just to boost my skills. The one *brilliant* resource I&rsquo;ve come across, and it really resonates with my ethos on the web, is [The Lean Web Club](https://leanwebclub.com/) from the amazing [Chris Ferdinandi](https://twitter.com/ChrisFerdinandi)

The lovely tweets sent by you lovely lot, regardless of the outcome of the live coding they really did help me out, super thankful for them all!
