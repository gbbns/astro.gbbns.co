It&rsquo;s safe to say that 2023 will hardly go down as a classic. Why is that I hear you ask? Well, for one redundancy. The after-effects of dealing with all the baggage that came with it, as well as the state of the technology job market due to the tough economy we&rsquo;re in (thanks, Tories, for ruining that too!), have had a massive impact on my mental wellbeing - more of that later.

## January started with so much promise

Well, I actually tell a small lie there because it fucking didn&rsquo;t.

Work was tough. Everyone was still dealing with the fallout of the somewhat disastrous re-org that had occurred late in the previous year. On a personal level, it allowed me to start collating notes &amp; thoughts on the questions &ldquo;What do I want to be doing?&rdquo;, &ldquo;How can I get the spark back?&rdquo;

Ironically, nearly a year later, these notes have helped provide me with clarity for a direction to head towards for 2024.

Some of my close colleagues were fortunate to gain meaningful employment in other organisations. Sadly this would mean team &amp; relationships we had worked so hard in forging over the previous 12-18months were slowly crumbling. Little did any of us know then that far worse was to come.

On a personal note, a seemingly innocuous training session (couch -> 5km) culminated in a torn meniscus and a stress fracture of the tibia that caused a bone marrow oedema, leaving me thinking training would be done for the foreseeable.

Thankfully, work had just started private healthcare (about the only good thing they had as a benefit). As much as I love and admire the NHS, it meant I was extremely fortunate to be able to jump the queue (surgery was completed in May, with discharge in June. 7 Wainwrights completed in July/August!)

## Easter bombshell &amp; Mid-year slump

The news of redundancy dropped THE DAY BEFORE EASTER - How is that for a big fuck you, and oh yea, enjoy the long weekend, culminating with my contract ultimately being terminated (such a crass phrase), over summer.

Whilst this wasn&rsquo;t ideal (is losing your job ever?), it did give me plenty of time to get lots of walking in, as well as getting a nice tan - at least on my arms/legs.

Job after job, after job, after job, after job got applied for infact, I&rsquo;ve already written about the process and how fucked it is in my weeknotes, as well as in post redundancy thoughts, it&rsquo;s probably best to read those then come back.

I was fortunate in August to land a position as Tech Principal (firmly focussed on Front End) at AND Digital. This took the immediate pressure off, I was relieved to be back in the game. I had a couple of weeks leave to look foward to, then was raring to go!

## Return of the&hellip;

And just when you think things are back on track, the demons that I had been fighting and pushing away all year make an overwhelming return. I am, of course, talking about mental health!

Anyone who knows me, knows I&rsquo;m neuro-diverse and suffer from MH issues - anxiety, depression and an eating disorder. I overshare that fact, not for sympathy but for awareness.

Most of the time, they are under control, either under my own volition, or that or SSRIs. I was put on Fluoxetine last year for about 6 months and they really helped, and in hindsight I might have been too eager to come off them, but hindsight is 2020.

Hopefully now I&rsquo;m back on the Fluoxetine they can help again, only this time I will be in less of a rush to come off them.

## Plans for 2024?

As I aluded too earlier, the notes I wrote back in January have helped provide me with clarity on a direction I want to persue.

### What do I want to be doing?

- FE &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; - Think the _good_ stuff, HTML/CSS/JS, prototyping, refining UX etc.
- Accessibility - We all know I&rsquo;m a *big* fan/advocate of accessibility, I want to do more in this space.
- Training and mentoring others.
- Public speaking
- Work with likeminded folk, not folk who are snarky or selfish!
- More work with design systems!

 There&rsquo;s a couple of other points, but they&rsquo;re not for sharing.

### How do I get the spark back?

- Look at what the me of 10 years ago wanted.
- Where do I get motivated?
- What&rsquo;s missing?
- What do I want to be doing in my job that I&rsquo;m not?
- Public speaking opportunities?
- How to write more?
- How can I manage neuro-diversity to enable me reading more?
- What does my ideal job look like, then work back.

After reflecting on these, I really want to push more into the design space, and firmly believe a move to a more &ldquo;design technologist&rdquo; focussed role is where I belong.

Well, there we go then. Hopefully, you enjoyed my little ramble. [Feel free to contact me if you fancy working together!](/contact/).

In the meantime I&rsquo;m off to find a very dark room for a lie down.

### Onwards to &rsquo;24
